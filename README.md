# Sleep Disorder Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of sleep disorders based on various health and lifestyle factors. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze sleep patterns and identify potential disorders.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model development and evaluation
- Model interpretability and visualization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains patient sleep-related information, including:

- **Sleep Duration**
- **Snoring Frequency**
- **Daily Activity Levels**
- **Stress Levels**
- **Medical History**

## 💊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores. The best model provides reliable predictions for identifying potential sleep disorders.
